Script to download all the free magazines from [raspberrypi.org](https://raspberrypi.org)

Today I realized that all the links for the magazine downloads had a similar structure but changed the issue number. 
So I decided to google about wget a bit to figure out how I could grab them all. 
Then I realized it was similar for their other magazines!


I'm sure someone has already done something like this but it was fun to play with for a half hour or so.

Then I got the bright idea to share!

## Instructions
* Clone the repository or just download the bash script
* Make sure you can run the script `chmod a+x`
* Run it inside a directory and it will create subfolders and start downloading


This could use a lot of work, feel free to submit your PRs!
